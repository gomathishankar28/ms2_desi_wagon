# **Introduction**

Desi Wagon is a mobile grocery truck that delivers Indian groceries, fruits, vegetables and spices mostly to the Indian diaspora in Netherlands. This company’s business proposition is to address the need for India items at affordable prices. Being a mobile delivery business model, this connects with the cities where the Indian population is concentrated in the Netherlands.

The reason to promote this business model in Netherlands is due to the scarce availability of Indian stores which in turn has led to monopolies in certain cities driving up the prices of indian staples. Mobile grocery units try to address this concern by bringing down the overheads of storefronts and service personnel and passing this cost benefit directly to the customers. 

Also, these units work on Just-in-time philosophy by replenishing stocks of only those items that are ordered by the customers. Currently the mobile truck services one city per weekday between 6 pm to 9 pm. In the trial phases, the items were ordered directly by the customer a week in advance through whatsapp. There were some inherent limitations to this ordering method as there was no proper order trace and it also led to a non-uniform format for orders.

The Purpose of this website is to comprehensively detail about the different delivery places and location itinerary of the delivery truck. Also, this site aims to provide a standardised form for the customers to place their orders.


## **Business Goals**
*   To target the growing Indian expat community who are looking for Indian groceries and Veggies

*   To evince interest in customers who prefer to have Indian groceries every week.

*   To bring this offering to Indians residing in the 5 big cities across Netherlands.

*   Provide a single, standard way to order items for all the customers.

*   To comprehensively list all the items that can be ordered.

*   Build a brand image for a Indian mobile grocery store.

*   Clearly communicate the delivery location details of the delivery truck.

*   To get notified through an email, for every order that gets placed.

## **user Goals**

## **UX**
### Ideal client
#### The ideal client for this business is:
*   Residing in the Netherlands.
*   Has a truck either on his own or on lease to transport the Groceries.
*   Has financial means to order a consignment of Indian groceries and Vegetables.
*   Wants to compete with the brick and Mortar stores selling Indian groceries in the identified cities.
*   English speaking.

#### Visitors to this website are searching for:
*   Indian groceries at competitive prices when compared to conventional stores.
*   A one-stop place where they can buy indian veggies, fruits, spices and other groceries.
*   A business model similar to a fast-food truck but delivering Indian groceries.
*   Information on the delivery details and location for customers to pick their orders.
*   An option in the website to place orders.

#### This Website is the best way to help the user and the owner because:
Currently the whole service is managed through Whatsapp group where customers message their grocery list. This invades privacy and is very awkward to let others know what each one is ordering. The time and place of order delivery is also messaged in the group. Each city has its own whatsapp group and is difficult to manage for the owner and sometimes leads to misinformation. This causes a lot of uncertainty which can be avoided by having this information in a central place. This transparency will be appreciated and will lead to better customer retention.

## **Strategy**
Build brand awareness for an Indian mobile grocery store.
Through this website , clearly communicate the items that are offered
Provide an easy option for users to send in their grocery list in advance
Maintain one website where all the information is available about Desiwagon
Aim to increase the subscriber base by attracting current customers of traditional Indian stores.

## **Scope**
**Functional requirements:**
*   A Navigation bar to guide the user experience across the website;
*   A Schedule section to display information about the day, time and city visited by Desiwagon.
*   A section to show the Location or address where Desiwagon would be stationed.
*   An Option to send the grocery list online.


**Content requirements:**

*   Content categorization based on offerings, Schedule, Location and Placing an order.
*   Use of Text and images to make things easy to understand.
*   A truck icon in the schedule section to show where the wagon is on a particular day.

## **Surface**

**Colors**

The color palette identifies itself with the colors of the Indian flag i.e. orange, green, white and blue. This is in line with the name of the store which colloquially means a wagon from India. This aims to establish a connect with the target Indian clientele and serve as a metaphor for an Indian Grocery store, as this Wagon only carries items from India.  

**Typography**

Two fonts were used for this project, Akaya Telivigala', cursive, and sans-serif with a sans-serif being fallback font. The cursive style fonts are a well-known typography choice, and are particularly popular on the web. Cursive writing fonts can give the website a more personal feel and approach media.

The Hero image displays a carousel with the colors of the Indian flag as a background and the wagon icon replacing the blue wheel that represents the Ashok chakra in the flag. All the other images used throughout the website are relative to our service. All images have been resized and compressed in order to boost the UX flow.

## **How to access Google Maps API**
Google requires you to register and to get an API key which is like a unique identifier that authorizes your website to use the API.
Every API has documentation about how to use it and google maps is no exception.The main thing that we need to do is to
get what's called an API key as you must have at least one API key associated with your project. 

### **To create an API key**
 1. Go to [google maps documentation] https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#quickstart
 2. In the Google Cloud Console, on the project selector page, click Create Project to begin creating a new Cloud project.
 3. click on create and give a project name and hit create.
 4. Make sure that billing is enabled for your Cloud project.
 5. Go to Maps API library page to see Google provides a lot of API's. but here we would just enable the Maps javascrip API. 
 6. Go to the APIs & Services > Credentials page.
 7. On the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key.The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.
 8. Click Close.The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys.(Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.) 

### **Restricting API keys**
1. Go to the APIs & Services > Credentials page from the given URL(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
2. Select the API key that you want to set a restriction on. The API key property page appears.
3. Under Key restrictions, set the following restrictions

*   **Application restrictions**

1.  To accept requests from the list of website that you supply, select HTTP referrers (web sites) from the list of Application restrictions.
2.  Specify one or more referrer web sites. For example, *.google.com accepts all sites ending in google.com, such as https://developers.google.com.

*   **API restrictions**
1.  Click Restrict key.
2.  Select Maps JavaScript API from Select APIs dropdown.
3.  If the Maps JavaScript API is not listed, you need to enable it.
4.  If your project uses Places Library, also select Places API. Similarly, if your project uses other services in the JavaScript API (Directions Service, Distance Matrix Service, Elevation Service, and/or Geocoding Service), you must also enable and select the corresponding API in this list.

* **Adding the API key to your request**
You must include an API key with every Maps JavaScript API request. In the following example, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.
paste the below script file in your html file before the closing body tag.
    
        <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap"
        type="text/javascript"></script>

## **How to use EmailJS API**
To use a service called EmailJS, we need to Set up an EmailJS account. Go to [Emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/)
and Create an EmailJS account.Then it involves the following steps.
1.  **Add an email service** - An email service provides integration between EmailJS and your email server. First open the Email Services (opens new window)tab where you will see two sections: Transactional email services and Personal email services.
    Personal email services allow connecting personal email providers that offer basic email functionality – an email address and an inbox. These include providers like Gmail, Fastmail, Outlook 365, etc'. 
    we choose to use the Gmail service. The name we are giving is send_list, and the service ID is desi_wagon. We then need to connect our account with Gmail by hitting the "Connect account" button and then pressing the Add Service button to complete the process.

2.  **Create an email template**
*   Click Create new template up at the top
*   Choose the blank template 
*   Fill in the subject, from , to and message fields with dynamic variables.
*   save the email template by pressing the Save button

3.  **Create a form in HTML** 
Use the code from the given url(https://www.emailjs.com/docs/tutorial/creating-contact-form/) as reference.

4.  **Connecting to EmailJS**
*   Go to the EmailJS website then documentation
*   Click on installation and copy the EmailJS SDK
*   Copy the code and paste the code in before the closing/head tag
*   Get your user ID - you can get this from the Instructions page in the EmailJS dashboard.
*   Paste it into your emailjs.init(). You can copy your custom EmailJS code (relating to parameters) and paste it into your JavaScript.
