Desi Wagon is a mobile grocery truck which delivers indian groceries, fruits, vegetables and spices to people in Netherlands.This Wagon aims to woo Indian expats who are searching for indian stuff in affordable price.

and has lower barriers to entry and lower costs to maintain, retrofit and operate.
